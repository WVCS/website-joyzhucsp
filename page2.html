    <h3> Since you were willing to look at the bad apps ( thank you for giving them a chance ଘ(੭ ᐛ )♡ ) you get the honor of seeing Mafia Duck! I just discovered him yesterday(´∀`) </h3>
       <p> Here's Mafia Duck standing ominously on a desk with his family portrait in the back. (Note the blood to the left of him.) I think it's so cute that the family photo has eggs in it </p>

       <p> Here's the full Mafia Duck family photo! </p>
        <p1> The photo doesn't show up on school wifi which I'm quite upset about. It's such a cute picture!!! </p1>
