    <h1> Since you were willing to look at the bad apps ( thank you for giving them a chance ଘ(੭ ᐛ )♡ ) you get the honor of seeing the Mafia Duck! I just discovered him yesterday (o´∀`o) </h1>
       <p> Here's Mafia Duck standing ominously on a desk with his family portrait in the back. (Note the blood to the left of him.) I think it's so cute that the family photo has eggs in it </p>
